 <h1>Tiramisu</h1>
 
<div1><p1>Tiramisu is a coffee-flavoured Italian dessert. It is made of ladyfingers (savoiardi) dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar and mascarpone, flavoured with cocoa. The recipe has been adapted into many varieties of cakes and other desserts.[1] Its origin is disputed between the Italian regions of Veneto and Friuli-Venezia Giulia. The name comes from the Italian tirami su (lit. 'pick me up' or 'cheer me up') </p1></div1>

 <h2>How to make tiramisu</h2>
<p2>Mix creamy filling. Beat the mascarpone, cream, sugar, and vanilla together until stiff peaks.
    Dip lady fingers. Add the espresso and liqueur (if using) to a shallow bowl and dip the lady fingers on both sides (don’t let them soak–just a quick dip!)
    Layer mascarpone. Smooth a layer of the mascarpone/whipped cream mixture on top of the lady fingers.
    Repeat. Add another layer of lady fingers (dipped in coffee and liqueur) and another layer of cheese mixture. Dust with cocoa powder.Tiramisu is even better when made in advance, allowing the flavors to blend! It will keep in the refrigerator for 2 to 3 days.
    To freeze, make completely, but don’t dust with cocoa powder. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and then tinfoil and freeze for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator overnight and dust with cocoa powder a few hours before serving.
